If you've stumbled here looking for pretty pictures and wire frames of what I've made in the past, find another designer.  Aesthetically driven designers tend to congregate [here](http://www.dribbble.com), [here](http://www.behance.com), and [here](http://www.cargocollective.com).  I solve complex and sophisticated problems which result in elegant solutions.  Aesthetics is just the tip of the iceberg.

The future defines me, not the past.  While I've worked on a plethora of really cool [projects](http://geoffreybyers.com/projects), my best work is yet to come.  If you want to be part of that, let's [talk](http://www.geoffreybyers.com/contact).  

Somebody said designers shouldn't code.  Fuck that guy.  This site is:

* Built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Designed and coded in CSS HTML and javascript
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com)

Cheers,

Geoffrey
