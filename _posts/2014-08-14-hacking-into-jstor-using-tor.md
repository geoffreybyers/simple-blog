##Introduction
JSTOR is a digital library of academic journals, books, and primary sources.  They provide access those privy to elite access to universities as well as a free account which provides limited access.[^1]  This information is guarded and extremely price prohibitive, sometimes costing an inflated price of up to hundreds of dollars per article.[^2]  JSTOR provides access based on the IP address of the computer accessing the website.  If that computer is on a college campus, any login will provide access to JSTOR with full university priority.[^3]  TOR, an anonymity network, obfuscates a user's identity by connecting a user through multiple users and finally an exit node.[^4]  TOR exit nodes are operated in many countries, including the US, as well as universities.Connecting to a TOR exit node in one of these university allows for JSTOR access.

##Downloading and Installing TOR

Download and Install TOR.[^5]  Restarting your computer is a good idea at this point. 

##Generating a JSTOR account

Now that TOR is installed, go ahead and launch TOR.  Once it opens and you get the initial splash page, visit Guerrilla Mail[^6] to generate a temporary, untraceable email address.  Copy this email address to your clipboard, leave this tab open and open a new tab.  In this new tab visit JSTOR's registration page[^7] and sign up using the email from Guerrilla Mail.  JSTOR should send you a link to this email address.  Confirm your sign up via email and then close TOR.

##Picking an exit node

We need to edit a specific configuration file in order to tell TOR to connect through a university exit node.  All exit nodes are viewable via Tor Network Status.[^8]  Search the page for '.edu' and numerous university exit nodes should pop up.  We need to then navigate to the torrc file in order to edit it.  

* On GNU/Linux - Tor folder > Data > Tor > torrc
* On OSX - Applications > TorBrowser > Data > Tor > torrc

Open the torrc file with a text editor like TextEdit and add the lines to the bottom of the file:

		StrictNodes 1
		ExitNodes routername

Change 'routername' to any of the other university exit nodes router names you found and save the file.

##Ignition
Start TOR, visit JSTOR, and log in using your previously created credentials.  Enjoy gratis access.

##Notes
* This method works for JSTOR and Artstor.
* Abusing JSTOR violates their TOS and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  Legal action has been perused in certain cases. [^9]
* Be aware of where you are when you do this (people at the IP address may be liable)
* Running a TOR exit node is legal.[^10]
* Using TOR does not guarantee safety, security, or privacy.[^11]
* Using Tails on a dedicated machine is better than TOR on your day to day OS.[^12]
* Using or even searching for TOR and/or Tails will place you on a watch list, and you will be labeled an extremist.[^13]
