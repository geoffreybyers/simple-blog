When I first launched my website around 2008, I registered my and hosted my domain with Godaddy.  Things weren't easy, and the experience left a lot to be desired (on top of the CEO killing an elephant). Earlier this year we started using [iwantmyname](http://www.iwantmyname.com) for Great Job and I was blow away at how straightforward and easy they made everything.  I started using them for my personal site earlier this month.  

When I realized I wanted to move away from a wordpress site and databases, I knew I could also ditch traditional hosting.  This is not true in many cases, however I sought out a simple lightweight solution.  I recently made the switch to Github, utilizing pages for hosting.  Hosting on github was a fun learning process without too steep of a curve.  It did utilize a domain ending in .github.io, which while fine for projects was not suitable for my site.  I'm proud to use github, but I'm more proud of my own brand.

iwantmydomain uses apps which make connecting things easier.  Connecting my domain to github was as simple as a few clicks and uploading a file to my github.  I couldn't be happier with the solution, however this left my email unhosted.  For a number of reasons I'm moving away from gmail and needed a cheap and painless solution.  While poking around on iwantmyname's apps section, I found they allowed for quickly connecting to a few providers.  Initially I wanted to use Rackspace, as I'm familiar with the company.  They wanted a minimum of $10 a month, and while email addresses are $2 a month that meant 4 unused email addresses I would be forced to support.  Maybe if I was running our company email through them things would add up, however I only need one email.  One of the other options and the one I would end up choosing is [FastMail](http://www.fastmail.fm).  At $40 a year plus a free two month trial was too good not to at least try.  Getting set up with FastMail was painless.  I had my account set up through mail on OSX and iOS very quickly.  Email began working within the hour.  Their webmail portal looks and works great too.  

If you are looking for a simple yet solid combination for web and email hosting I suggest checking out github, iwantmyname, and FastMail.
