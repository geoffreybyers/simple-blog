As a designer I had shyed away from coding until recently.  I could easily stick to user research and validation, sketching, lo and hifi mockups, and some clunky prototypes.  No matter the scope or depth of the project, the concepts always lacked the interactivity I intended.  As part of larger teams in the past, prototyping had been left to members with CS degrees who were proficient in a multitude of languages.  Fast forward to starting Great Job and all of a sudden I was thrown into a pool and coded my way out. 

Like many other Gen Xers I put together a few websites in text editors and built websites with help from Dreamweaver.  In highschool I dabbled in a bit more html and some visual basic without much of an intent or desire.  Without purpose, I didn't really care to learn something that was undoubtedly challenging and daunting.

I really started with creating physical prototypes with Arduino during my time at Siemens.  This was in part because I needed a creative outlet for all of my ideas, I wanted something tangible aside from pure UX work, and a competition a former studio mate and I had.  We launched an installation piece and I later focused on a kombucha brewer which I got working before my departure.

While starting any large endeavor, it's nearly impossible to keep everything tight early on as there are simply too many moving pieces.  After starting Great Job, we had a pretty lousy wordpress site.  I jumped onto building the next version of our site which was basic html and css.  Most of the time went into the styling, as is of the utmost importance when developing a minimalist style.  The code was decent, though the CSS was a messy organization that only I could easily parse through.

I later prototyped the initial version of Wordoko, which was later used for testing and showing to dev teams.  In the sake of the MVP, I strung together pieces of code from different areas - namely canvases, JS drawing and a menu structure.  It was very much so hacked together, but that was all the time and budget the project called for.  In the end, the client was super excited with the webapp I had put together and we still have an awesome relationship with him.

I used Bootstrap and Flat UI to prototype the Empeopled concept.  Instead of jumping into Photoshop and handing that off to the developer, we were able to hand off exactly what we intended.  We provided the team a very basic spec document, code with comments and a functioning prototype.  

I admit, coding is scary.  It's also easy to "leave it to the experts".  However, when carrying a concept forward it has helped immensely for me to indicate interactions, explore micro-interactions,  and test functioning concepts.  Code academy is a "safe" start if you're risk adverse.  If you're not, jump in and try to make your concepts come to life.  I challenge you.
