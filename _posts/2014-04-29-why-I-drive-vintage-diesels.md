##tl;dr##
I own two vintage German diesel cars.  They're quirky, unique and pleasurable drivers.

##Obsession##
I own and drive two vintage German diesel automobiles.  I've searched for years and flown across the country to buy them.  It began with an attraction to the boxy, yet sophisticated 1980's Mercedes 300D.  The legendary body style of the w123 along with the bulletproof drive chain is in my opinion one of the greatest automobiles of all time.  I then became interested in the mark 2 VW golf and later the mark 1 golf.  My first car of my own was and still is my 1979 VW golf, or rabbit as they branded them in North America.  I flew out to Salt Lake City to finalize the deal done via ebay and drove it back the 2,156 miles to Savannah, GA.  I later picked up a 1972 Mercedes 220d from a close friend who did not want to deal with the headaches that came with it.  Both cars have lead to some of my most memorable times on the road.

##Simplicity##
I have an affinity towards simple, well designed and well built things.  Before I procured my VW, I couldn't work on cars past changing a wheel and the oil.  Both the VW and the Mercedes are extremely simple cars when compared to modern cars.  While the VW was and is in exceptional mechanical condition, I learned the ins and outs of performing preventative maintenance.  The Mercedes was in much poorer mechanical condition, however over the last year I've been slowly restoring it to it's former glory.  Both automobiles are manual everything.  The electrical systems are sans engine computers and fuel is delivered via a mechanical fuel pump.  

##Efficiency##
Diesels use high compression as opposed to a spark plug to initiate combustion.  This results in a drastically more efficient engine.  Saving money was a plus, however I am infatuated by waste reduction and getting the most out of what I have.  People often ask me if I've converted my cars to run on biodiesel.  I've changed out the fuel lines to synthetic so that my cars handle biodiesel well, however I've only run blends up to this point.  Both cars would run on dyno diesel, biodiesel or even waste oil, known as WVO.  I've also yet to brew my own biodiesel.

##Reliability##
Both of my cars, and many of the older diesels are legendary in terms of reliability.  I do all of my own maintenance thanks to the folks over at <a href="http://forums.vwvortex.com/">VW Vortex</a> and Ken Bergma of <a href="https://mercedessource.com/">Mercedes Source</a>.  These are just two of the few wonderful communities which help with advice and sourcing of harder to find parts.  Most things are reasonably priced, however certain parts for the Mercedes are exceptionally hard to source.  I am very hands on with my cars, which contributes to the reliability.  These cars, especially the older ones, are definitely not set it and forget it.

##Character##
I've had my cars and diesels in general compared to living creatures.  I'm not sure if it's the engines purring at the same rate a a cat or not (26 cycles per second).  I think it comes from the quirkiness of the car, and the workhorse industrial reputation of diesel engines.
