##tl;dr##
I travel a lot.  Between Chicago, San Francisco, New Orleans, Dallas and Denver to name a few places I frequent.  I've learned to travel cheaply by utilizing a few tools and techniques.  In all honestly, just travel on ticket prices as opposed to specifically fixed dates.  It'll save you a ton.  Regardless, use some of the tools on Kayak to try to squeeze some money out of those ticket purchases.

##My cheapest ticket##
During my time in Dallas, I booked an all time low ticket for $24 on Spirit Airlines to New Orleans.  For the price of 3 drinks I was back in my home city enjoying some of the best jazz music in the world.  Sure, Dallas is a hub.  Sure, Dallas and New Orleans is a 500 mile ~7 hour drive.  No, I'm not a member of the $9 fare club.  No, I didn't hack in the sense of breaking into a database to get an artificially low fare.  I used a few techniques I've been developing over the last year to get an ultra low fare.  This is just one example of the many cheap flights I've scored.  

##Travel as a commodity##
One of the important realizations I made was that flying domestically is a commodity.  It's not a service, at least that's not how the industry treats it.  It's an all out race for the bottom.  If you look at flying in this way, in the end you're getting from one place to another regardless of airline.  I don't believe airlines are quantitatively or even qualitatively better.  I do think Virgin is in a league of it's own domestically.  After that, it's a rat race and price is the only differentiating factor.

##Travel based on location, with flexible dates##
Probably the most important thing I do to lower fares is to embrace the mentality that I want to get somewhere specific, within a date range.  I make things work.  Sure, holiday travel will always have massive peaks.  You can still avoid things like weekend peaks and some holiday peaks too by nimbly traveling around them.  People like me buy the less desirable tickets.  Sometimes this means traveling on holiday days.  It often means traveling during the middle of the day and during the week days.  As I work from wherever I am, this doesn't really matter and I make up for the travel time by working without my computer.

##Use Kayak's tools##
I use Kayak for most of my initial flight researching.  This is mainly because of their tools: price alert, price matrix, and price trend.

###Price alert###
In short, you create an alert for a searched flight.  You are then emailed as prices drop.  I usually search multiple times through the day/night across multiple days to track this myself.  It's useful if you're into automation or reminders though.

###Price matrix###
Searching across multiple days makes sense if you've got very restricted travel-ability.  As I'm open to all options I use the matrix to see when flights are cheapest if time is a variable.  I use this more than price alert, as it lets me check nearly all potential flights simultaneously.

###Price Trend###
This is a fascinating and, in my opinion, the most useful feature of Kayak.  You can use their graph of prices of tickets to figure out whether to buy a flight now, or whether to wait it out and see if the price falls.

##Choose your fare##
I've used Priceline to get steep discounts up to 40% on flights.  This was true of last minutes flights during peak times too.  The interesting point here is that you bid with the agreement that if you win your credit card is charged.  You can still specify times you're willing to travel so that you're not stuck with red eye flights.  

##Buy one way tickets##
I've noticed that buying round trip tickets is often easier on the consumer, however not necessarily cheaper.  Buying multiple one way tickets allows for the maximum flexibility regarding airlines as well as time and date.  I often buy multiple one way tickets back to back.  This is by far the easiest way to do trips with more than one destination other than paying a travel agent.

##Include nearby airports##
Many times, you may have one option to fly to a set destination.  Other times, flying across the country to LA can be had for cheaper by flying through SFO, renting a car, and driving.  This is true of most places where airports are within reasonable driving or public transportation distance.

##Pack light##
Being a minimalist, packing light isn't difficult.  However, catching last minute flights, giving up seats for vouchers and avoiding luggage costs can be avoided by packing a small duffel or backpack.
