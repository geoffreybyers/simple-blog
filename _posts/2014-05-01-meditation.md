##tl;dr##
Meditation might help you increase focus, work output, optimism while decreasing stress and bullshit.

##A Massive Challenge##
Lack of focus has never been a weakness of mine.  Anxiety due to stress in the face of being overloaded, however, is.  I thrive in stressful environments.  This would include coming into projects at critical moments and steering the ship in the right direction.  Some call this damage control.  I see it as much more than that.  I was calling in for such a project during my time at Siemens.  The product was one of those legendary projects of the magnitude I had been lusting to encounter.  The product was named [Automation Designer](http://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/products/nx/ "Automation Designer"), for the PLM product - NX.  As in the CAD software formerly knows as Unigraphics.  This was the descendant of the first CAM product for users dating back to 1969.  Automation Designer was the redesign attempt of a failed engineering driven platform.  Basically engineers built this insanely complicated software, users could not use it, contracts were in jeopardy and I was called in to lead  the design effort.  I'll dig in deeper into the project and what I learned in another post.  Needless to say, this was stressfully especially when piled on top of a few other projects and the fact that this was my first major project with coworkers working beneath me.  I turned inward toward meditation to learn to stay focused and navigate my way through the project successfully.

##My first attempts##
Out of necessity I left my team and our building whenever I felt my work was being impacted.  I'd lie down in a secluded patch outside, where my managers or coworkers would not interrupt my meditation.  I'd turn off my phone, aside from an alarm, and focus on breathing and quieting my thoughts.  I didn't listen to music, or guided meditation.  I didn't sit in any poses, and I didn't read any books.  I just needed to do, and I did.  The results were amazing.  Regardless of the hailstorm that was going on between myself and computers thousands of miles away, I would get myself back on track.  One fifteen minute session I would let go of everything going on, and meditate until I would realize I was alright.  If anything I began to meditate more frequently, but for shorter amounts of time.  This was exceptionally useful when a long chain of emails would make the project feel as if it was taking two steps forward and fifteen backwards.

##What is meditation##
Well, it's rather intangible.  The best explanation I have is that if you're meditating you're doing it right.  It's not about getting somewhere, it's about the journey.  Just focusing on your thoughts, or not, while relaxed and not in front of a glowing screen constitutes meditation.  Eyes opened or closed, prone position or full lotus it doesn't matter.  Letting go does.

##Getting Started##
Don't worry about meditation challenges, techniques or outcomes.  If you're going to try this, I recommend embracing it as an experiment and starting with the intent to meditate at least once a day for 5 days in a row.  I do not believe in the 28 day rule for habit forming.  That's a myth.  I do believe in one week sprints.  Time of the day isn't as important as purpose and frequency.  My purpose was to mitigate stress at work, so I would meditate at work when I needed breaks.  What's keeping you from accomplishing greatness?
